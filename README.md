# GAS-bootstrap
Repository to have a bootstrap model served by Google Apps Script
It is based on the nice work from bootstrap team & contributors (getbootstrap.com), kudos to them!

The basic idea is to have a working, standalone set-up that can be serve by a google Apps script. It is most useful for your standalone apps, but could also be used in combination if you embed the apps in your site and have customized CSS!

# Installation
Start a new GAS from your google file.
Copy paste all files (separate files!) and publish your web server.
